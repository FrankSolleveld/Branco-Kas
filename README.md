# Branco-Kas
- CLE3 App Project

Branco Kas is a test app made solely in Swift to show students what is possible by writing simple code.
This app is meant as a controller for a Kamergotchi-like plant. You, together with a team, need to take care of a little plant which is growing
in the Brancoplein in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. 

This app is open source. This means that you can use is for whatever purposes you see fit. 

- Licht.swift
This .swift file makes sure that if you press on one of the colored buttons in the Licht.ViewController, a black border will appear around it.
A label below the buttons will match the button that is pressed at that time.

- Water.swift
This .swift file takes care of the Water.ViewController. Here you can press the water drop to give the plant some water.
Be aware that if you press the drop one more time, an alert box will appear. You can onli give water once every ten seconds.
You can change this.

- Live.swift
This .swift file takes care of the Live.ViewController. Basically what this code does is that when you press the 'Go LIVE'-button, a video will appear.

- Groep.swift
This last .swift file handles the Groep.ViewController. Here is states a static group number with a picture of group 1. This can be altered in the code.
